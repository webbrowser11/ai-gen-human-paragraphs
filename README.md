working on skyos has been a fun mix of coding and figuring out cool ways to make things work. me and my team, all around the same age, have been adding features like error handling and file navigation, and even some neat apps. one of my favorites is the "tree" command, which makes working with data kind of fun and different.

there have been some tricky parts, like getting things to work across windows, linux, and mac, or fixing bugs in updates. but it’s worth it when things come together. skyos is this big project that’s always changing, and it’s cool to see how far it’s come.
